    "Sat": "Have you found the orchard yet, @? It'll have run wild by now. Used to pick cherries there.#$b#Tedious job, I wouldn't recommend it, although it does give you time to think. Mostly about the other things you'd rather be doing, admittedly.",
    "Sun": "If you see Clint, can you try and convince him his old mom isn't a dragon, please?#$b#I'm afraid we had a bit of a falling out... I hope one day he'll forgive me.$2",

    "Mon2": "That blasted macaw... it was Clem's you know. He won it in a card game.#$b#Clem was positively shite at cards, so I've no doubt it was rigged. Probably just wanted rid of the damned thing.$1",
