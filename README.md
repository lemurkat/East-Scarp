# East-Scarp

ADDED in 2.2
- Rosa's 10 heart event (complete with personalized stationery, additional content if Mr Ginger and/or Jessie & Juliet installed and finally, that recipe.
- moves the arrival of Josephine and Oliver forward and removes the "talk to them at the luau" requirement.
- After Josephine's story arc is finished, Kataryna moves into town.
- before Josephine leaves town, Kataryna will visit town once a season to catch up with her colleague/s
- Heart events for Kataryna both before and after her becoming social (20+ events if Juliet installed)
- 10-heart event for Lexi (including player receiving that seed)
- added FOUR new fish - Fairy Betta to orchard and Fairy Pond (Tristan); Obsidian Maw and Slime Barbel to the Abandoned Mine entrance. King Carp to the Deep Mountains.
- refined some maps: Inn, Aideen's house, Jessie's Lodging House, vet house to make room for future NPCs or just to make things look tidier.
- added a new NPC (Kataryna, unlockable) and a new antisocial NPC (also unlockable).
- moved barn animals into Custom Companions, so they can now rotate indoors and outdoors.
- Rival Heart events for Aideen/??? if ??? is installed.
- set separate fishing locations in the orchard.
- added future proof code for Lavril/Vivienne.
- spouse room and patio added for Kataryna (plus schedule and home for her "pet" if you marry her) 
- added compatibility with SVR3, including refining festival positions.
- added more dangerous enemies to the Abandoned Mine Entrance map. At low levels, It is recommended you DO NOT go there after 6pm.
- enlarged Deep Mountains crevasse lake for higher quality fish
- redesigned the maps to improve their aesthetics.
- adjusts the edibility/value of the fish to make them more balanced (also nudibranches are now poisonous) 

BUG FIXES:
- Josephine may now arrive on the bus to visit the resort/Market Day. She also attends some festivals.
- Fixed flower blocking passage when exiting the abandoned mine map
- minor map tweaks and fixes to: clipping through Inn basement and shack walls, one tree, and possibly some other things.
- fixed an issue where it was impossible to catch starred fish from the tidepools
- fixed those walls on the shack so you can no longer meander into the void. (edited)
